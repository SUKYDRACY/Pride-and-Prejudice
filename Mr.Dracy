	<pre id="best-content-1543307642" accuse="aContent">Mr Darcy: Miss Elizabeth. I have struggled in vain and can bear it no longer. These past months have been a torment. I came to Rosings only to see you. I have fought against judgement, my family's expectation,the inferiority of your birth, my rank. I will put them aside and ask you to end my agony. <br>    <br>Miss Elizabeth: I don't understand. 
<img src="sence.jpg" width="1430" height="583" /><br>          <br>Mr Darcy: I love you.Most ardently. Please do me the honour of accepting my hand. <br>        <br>Miss Elizabeth: Sir, I appreciate the struggle you have been through, and I am very sorry to have caused you pain. It was unconsciously done. <br>           <br>Mr Darcy: Is this your reply? <br>          <br>Miss Elizabeth: Yes, sir. <br>         <br>Mr Darcy: Are you laughing at me? <br>           <br>Miss Elizabeth: No. <br>          <br>Mr Darcy: Are you rejecting me? <br>              <br>Miss Elizabeth: I'm sure the feelings which hindered your regard will help you overcome it. <br>Mr Darcy: Might I ask why with so little civility I am thus repulsed? <br>            <br>Miss Elizabeth: I might enquire why you told me you liked me against your better judgement? If I was uncivil, then that is some excuse.  But you know I have other reasons. <br>         <br>Mr Darcy: What reasons? <br>            <br>Miss Elizabeth: Do you think anything might tempt me to accept the man who has ruined the happiness of a most beloved sister? Do you deny that you separated a young couple who loved each other, exposing your friend to censure for caprice and my sister to derision for disappointed hopes, involving them both in acute misery? <br>            <br>Mr Darcy: I do not deny it. <br>           <br>Miss Elizabeth: How could you do it? <br>           <br>Mr Darcy: I believed your sister indifferent to him. I realised his attachment was deeper than hers. <br>          <br>Miss Elizabeth: <a href="https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=She%27s&tn=44039180_cpr&fenlei=mv6quAkxTZn0IZRqIHckPjm4nH00T1YdmWDzPA7WuWw-nWn1PH010ZwV5Hcvrjm3rH6sPfKWUMw85HfYnjn4nH6sgvPsT6KdThsqpZwYTjCEQLGCpyw9Uz4Bmy-bIi4WUvYETgN-TLwGUv3EP1DsPHc1rjnkP1DznWckPHcd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">She's</a> shy! <br>        <br>Mr Darcy: Bingley was persuaded she <a href="https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=didn%27t&tn=44039180_cpr&fenlei=mv6quAkxTZn0IZRqIHckPjm4nH00T1YdmWDzPA7WuWw-nWn1PH010ZwV5Hcvrjm3rH6sPfKWUMw85HfYnjn4nH6sgvPsT6KdThsqpZwYTjCEQLGCpyw9Uz4Bmy-bIi4WUvYETgN-TLwGUv3EP1DsPHc1rjnkP1DznWckPHcd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">didn't</a> feel strongly. Miss Elizabeth: You suggested it. Mr Darcy: For his own good.<br>           <br>Miss Elizabeth: My sister hardly shows her true feelings to me. I suppose his fortune had some bearing? <br>              <br>Mr Darcy: I wouldn't do your sister the dishonour. It was suggested... <br>              <br>Miss Elizabeth: What was? <br>            <br>Mr Darcy: It was clear an advantageous marriage... <br>        <br>Miss Elizabeth: Did my sister give that impression? <br>        <br>Mr Darcy: No! No. There was, however, your family... <br>           <br>Miss Elizabeth: Our want of connection? <br>             <br>Mr Darcy: No, it was more than that. <br>     <br>Miss Elizabeth: How, sir? Mr Darcy: The lack of propriety shown by your mother, younger sisters and your father. Forgive me. You and your sister I must exclude from this. <br>       <br>Miss Elizabeth: And what about Mr Wickham? <br>         <br>Mr Darcy: Mr Wickham? <br>      <br>Miss Elizabeth: What excuse can you give for your behaviour? <br>         <br>Mr Darcy: You take an eager interest. <br>          <br>Miss Elizabeth: He told me of his misfortunes. <br>        <br>Mr Darcy: Oh, they have been great. <br>                    <br>Miss Elizabeth: You ruin his chances yet treat him with sarcasm. <br>       <br>Mr Darcy: So this is your opinion of me? Thank you. Perhaps these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurtby my scruples about our relationship. I am to rejoice in the inferiority of your circumstances? <br>       <br>Miss Elizabeth: And those are the words of a gentleman. Your arrogance and conceit, your selfish disdain for the feelings of others made me realise you were the last man in the world I could ever marry. <br>          <br>Mr Darcy: Forgive me, madam, for taking up so much of your time.</pre>
